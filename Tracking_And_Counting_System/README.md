# Tracking and Counting System
Before attempting to run the PersonTracker.py, download and place the two extra weights "yolov3_custom.tf.data-00001-of-00002" and "yolov3_custom.weights" into the weights folder. The download link is " https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d2xOZxa4LUcvA2nQumzAQ9UDMYG9Cbgn?usp=share_link "
These were placed on the google drive because they were too large to upload on GitHub. Note: The raw surveillance video sequences used to test the system can be found inside the folder labeled "data/video". The processed output videos from the testing phase can be found inside the folder "data/video/Test Results".
